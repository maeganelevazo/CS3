			<h1>The Purge: Election Year</h1>
			<p>In America, to lessen the overpopulation and the crime rate, the New Founding Fathers created an annual 12-hour period event where crime--including murder is legal. Sen. Charlie Roan, a young woman who survived a purge night that took her family, ran as a president which can be the way to stop the event. Her opponents, on the other hand, which is also the president of the NFFA removed the rule where officials of ranking 10 will be immuned from the purge night before the election.</p>
